# Voice Balancer Bot

Discord bot to find out the optimal volume settings for people in a voice channel!
Use `/measure` to have the bot join your voice channel, measure everyone's loudness, and recommend at what % you should set everyone's volume at.

This bot uses an experimental voice receiving implementation for discord.py from https://github.com/OdielDomanie/discord.py/tree/add-voicereceive-support
