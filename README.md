# Voice Balancer Bot

Discord bot to find out the optimal volume settings for people in a voice channel!

It uses the international loudness measurement standard [ITU-R BS.1770-4](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-4-201510-I!!PDF-E.pdf) for optimal measurement.

Use `/measure` to have the bot join your voice channel, measure everyone's loudness, and recommend at what % you should set everyone's volume at.

## Example

For example, if you are "Fev", you should set others' volumes at 84% and 90% percents, while the other two people should set you at 75% percent.

This will make your Discord audio _balanced_ on your end; if it makes everyone too loud or too silent, you would need to adjust Discord's audio as a whole.

(The dB values are just for additional information, and show the needed adjustments in dB relative to a target of -28 LUFS.)

### Permissions
The bot requires "Connect" permission.  
In addition, "View Channels (Read Messages)" permission is needed for **only** the Voice Channels; you can disable this permission for every other channel.
